# Instructions for Claude

## When Doing Development or Testing Work

**Before ANY development or testing tasks, read DEVELOPMENT.md first.**

DEVELOPMENT.md contains critical environment setup instructions that prevent:
- Test failures from incorrect paths
- Files created in wrong locations
- Development work polluting production environment

## Execution Pattern

1. Read DEVELOPMENT.md (if not already read this session)
2. Follow setup instructions in DEVELOPMENT.md
3. Verify environment is configured correctly
4. Proceed with development or testing tasks
